# ML Classifier: Hand Gesture Recognition Using Machine Learning

## Project Title

ML Classifier aims to utilize computer vision and deep learning techniques to classify hand gestures into rock, paper, and scissors. The project employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of hand gesture images to accurately identify the correct gesture from a captured image.

## Brief Description

ML Classifier leverages deep learning to recognize and classify hand gestures, enabling interactive and accessible applications. Train the CNN model and utilize it to predict hand gestures in real-time, unlocking a range of possibilities in human-computer interaction, gaming, and accessibility.
